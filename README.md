A super simple website for image sharing &amp; voting.

Registered users can upload images with a short description; anyone can browse recently uploaded images, vote them +1 or -1, and view the top 10 most popular images.

An early experiment of mine when I was first toying with PHP/MySQL, the idea of MVC, & AJAX. Site is no longer live.
